# \<%= title %\> Format

## Into: What is this?

Initial attempt at creating a quarto extension for reusable templates. More sophisticated approach than what is available in my 'quarto-templates' repo.

## Installing template

*TODO*: Replace the `<github-repo>` with your GitHub repo.

``` bash
quarto use template <github-repo>/<%= filesafename %>
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Installing Extension

``` bash
quarto add <github-repo>
```

## Using

*TODO*: Describe how to use your format.

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [example.qmd](example.qmd).
